## Changing Background Images and Videos

Images and video assets are stored in the `public/assets/` folder.

- **Main Page Background Video:**  
  - Path: `public/assets/videos/arca-hero.mp4`
  - Change by replacing this file or updating its path in `src/components/Hero.tsx`:
    ```jsx
    <source src={getAssetPath('/assets/videos/arca-hero.mp4')} type="video/mp4" />
    ```

- **Research/Project Images:**  
  - Store images in `public/assets/images/research/`
  - Update their references in the project data file `src/data/researchProjects.ts`

- **Team Photos and Other Images:**  
  - Store in `public/assets/images/team/` for team members
  - Update as referenced in `src/components/TeamSection.tsx`

> **Tip:**  
> To add a new image or video, simply put your file into the appropriate folder and reference it using a relative path (ex: `/assets/images/yourimage.jpg`).

## Editing/Adding Research Projects

All research project entries are managed in [`src/data/researchProjects.ts`](src/data/researchProjects.ts).

- **Add a New Project:**  
  1. Open `src/data/researchProjects.ts`
  2. Add an object to the `researchProjects` array with this structure:
      ```ts
      {
        id: 'unique-project-id',
        title: 'Project Title',
        description: 'Short description for cards',
        longDescription: [
          'Paragraph 1.',
          'Paragraph 2 (optional).'
        ],
        image: '/assets/images/research/your-image.jpg',
        videoSrc: '/assets/videos/your-video.mp4', // optional
        publications: [
          {
            title: 'Publication Title',
            authors: 'Author list',
            year: 2023,
            source: 'Journal/Conference',
            link: 'https://...'
          }
        ],
        relatedResearch: ['other-project-id'] // optional
      }
      ```
  3. Put image and video files in their respective folders.

- **Edit/Remove Existing Projects:**  
  - Edit or remove objects from the `researchProjects` array as needed.

## Managing Team Members

Team members are defined directly in [`src/components/TeamSection.tsx`](src/components/TeamSection.tsx).

- **Add/Edit a Team Member:**
  1. Open `TeamSection.tsx`
  2. Update the `teamMembers` array:
      ```js
      {
        name: 'Full Name',
        role: 'Position or title',
        bio: 'Short biography...',
        image: '/assets/images/team/filename.jpg'
      }
      ```
  3. Add their photo to `public/assets/images/team/`

- **Remove a Member:**  
  - Simply remove their entry from the array.

## Updating Publications

The publications list for the main site can be edited in [`src/components/PublicationsSection.tsx`](src/components/PublicationsSection.tsx):

- **To add or update a publication:**
  1. Edit the `publications` array:
      ```js
      {
        title: 'Title of the publication',
        authors: 'Authors',
        journal: 'Journal or Conference',
        year: 2024,
        link: 'https://...'
      }
      ```

## Changing the Hero Section (Landing Page)

- **To update the hero (landing) section video or image:**  
  1. Upload a new video to `public/assets/videos/`  
  2. Change the video `src` in `src/components/Hero.tsx`  
  3. The title text can also be changed directly in `Hero.tsx` (within the `<h1>` tag)

- **To update the Open Graph (social sharing) image:**  
  1. Replace the value of the `<meta property="og:image" ... />` tag in `index.html`:
      ```html
      <meta property="og:image" content="/lovable-uploads/f65dcf06-e07a-41ab-8768-4d5d0f21fe8d.png" />
      ```
  2. This ensures social media platforms use the correct preview image.

---

## Updating Contact Information

- The contact form is handled in [`src/components/ContactSection.tsx`](src/components/ContactSection.tsx).
- If using Formspree or another provider, update the endpoint in the formâ€™s `action` property:
    ```jsx
    <form action="https://formspree.io/f/your-endpoint" method="POST" ...>
    ```

---

## Deployment & Local Development

- **Local Development:**
  ```sh
  npm install
  npm run dev
  # Visit http://localhost:8080
  ```

- **Deploying:**  
  - For static hosting (like GitHub Pages), just push to your main branch; GitHub Actions will handle deployment.

- **Custom Domain:**  
  - Use the domain/DNS settings in your repository and add a CNAME file as needed.

---

## Advanced Customization

- **Styling:**  
  - For site-wide styles and color changes, edit `tailwind.config.ts`
  - For per-section changes, edit individual files in `src/components/`

- **Routing/Pages:**  
  - Adjust routes in `src/App.tsx` as desired.
